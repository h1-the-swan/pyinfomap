# Pyinfomap: Python implementation of [Infomap](http://www.mapequation.org)

Fork of <https://github.com/uwescience/pyinfomap> MDL (map equation calculator)

Updated with algorithm implemented by Jason Portenoy

Uses the Louvain method, iteratively joining modules into super-modules to optimize the map equation.

Requires NetworkX

## Running

Takes a pajek network file (`.net`) as input, and outputs a tree file with the clustering found

`python pyinfomap.py input.net [output-directory] [options]`

This will write a `.tree` file with the same name as the input `.net` file to [output-directory]. If [output-directory] is not specified, it will write to standard out.
